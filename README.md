# Christmas Project:
## All the steps come from these websites:
  * ### "Getting start with LEDs" [Link to the website](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/getting-started-with-electronics-leds-and-switches-using-raspberry-pi)
  * ### "LEDs with Buttons and GPIO Pins" [Link to the website](https://www.hackster.io/Tisko/rgb-led-a-button-click-away-9886c1)
  * ### "How to set up static IP address" [link to the website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/tcpip/)
## Material List:
  * ### Female to Male cables
  * ### Male cables
  * ### Two Raspberry Pi Zero
  * ### A laptop
  * ### 3D printer
  * ### Solderless Breakboard
  * ### 2x 470Î© Resistors
  * ### 1x cathode LED
  * ### 2x tactile buttons
 
 ## Coding Part:
 ### Log into your raspberrypi with your username and password.

 ### First, type in the following line to download a module called "RPi.GPIO"
 ![image of downloading]()
 ### Enter the following line and create a python file called "chris.py"

 ## Building Part:
 ### Install the Cathode LED and the tactile button according to this graph:

 ## Set Up SSH:
 ### Type in the following line
 ![image of IP]()
 ### Then delete all the "#" before those four lines.

 ### After that, check your Static IP Address by enter "hostname -I" Make sure to use the last digits
 ### Then, plug this Raspberrypi Zero into a portable charger and then set it aside. Grab a new Raspberrypi Zero and log in with Putty as usual.
 ### Enter "pi@xyz", which "xyz" is your Static IP Address, then enter the password.
 ### Congratulation! You successfully log in to the Raspberrypi Zero with the code on it!

 ## 3D-Design Part:
 ### Use a website called "tinkercad to design your box"
 ![image of box]()
 ### After you have accomplished all the steps above, assemble your "toy" into the box your just made
 ### Congratulation! You successfully made a Christamas toy! Have fun!
